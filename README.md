# Multivac Unstaking Tool 
A script to track the total amount of Multivac tokens being unstaked from the pool.

## Details
Firstly, it pulls all active staking addresses from the explorer api, then proceeds to check each address for the value in `withdrawPending` and outputs progress. After each address has been checked we save the data into the directory `mtv_logs` with each file being time-stamped and output it in a more human readable format.
